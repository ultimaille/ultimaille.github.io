Ultimaille is a lightweight library that provides a friendly way to manipulate a surface/volume mesh, it is meant to be used by your geometry processing software. Ultimaille provide the following functionalities:
 
 - Read / write meshes in many file formats: `.obj`, `.mesh`, `.geogram`...
 - Browse a mesh, iterating through its vertices, edges, faces
 - Modifying a mesh
 - Write custom data - named attributes - on meshes primitives (vertices, faces, edge corners...)
 - Manipulating basic algebra: vectors, matrices 
 - Some helpers like disjoint sets or k-NN queries

Note: This library does not contain any ready-to-execute remeshing algorithms.

Ultimaille has been designed to be simple, concise, easy to use and maintenable library that is able to do common mesh handling tasks for surfaces and volumes.
